# Advice-Generator-App
This is my solution to the Advice Generator App from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db
)
In this challange I've used Advice Slip API (https://api.adviceslip.com)


## Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

In this challange I practiced how to interact with API's by using async, await and fetch methods
